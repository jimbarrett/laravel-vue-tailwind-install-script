# laravel-vue-tailwind-install-script
Script that I use to set up a Laravel dev environment with Vue and Tailwind.

Accepts one parameter for the name of the directory where laravel will be installed.

run:  
sh laravel myprojectname

Follow the prompts. 

(Currently only works with MySQL)

Someday I may create a proper README. But not today.
